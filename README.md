# Repo for creating interactive research plots

First example takes the Figures from the Atlas3D paper I wrote with Davor Krajnovic and creates interactive versions.
Plots are created using the dimple.js](http://dimplejs.org/) bubble plot library.

The full paper can be downloaded here from the NASA/ADS service;
[The ATLAS3D Project - XXIII. Angular momentum and nuclear surface brightness profiles](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.433.2812K)
and the sources files from [astro-ph:1305.4973](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4973)
